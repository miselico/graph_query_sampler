"""A sample specifies a portion of the queries"""


from typing import Callable, Union


class Sample:
    """
    A sample is a part of a split.

    You can specify which part of the data to be included and how many you want from this part.
    The final amounts will be sampled proportionally from the different matching data files.

    Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            The selector allows simple glob operations,
            for example `"/**/1qual/"` will select queries with one qualifier.
        amount : int, str, or a callable
            How many elements to sample from the sets indicated.
            This is specified by either:
                * a number indicating the amount
                * the string "*" indicating all
                * a callable that, given the total number available returns how many to sample.
            The latter can be used to control the amount depending on what is in the dataset,
               e.g., at most 10000  `lambda available: min(10000, available)` or
               10% of the data `lambda available: int(0.10 * available)`
        reify: bool, default=False
            Should the query be reified during the load?
            If True, triples which have qualifiers will be reified and an extra variable node will be added
            to represent the blank node. Then, for each qualifier a respective statement will be added with the
            respective node as the subject.In effect, the queries will have explicit qualifiers.

            This option conflicts with remove_qualifiers. Only one of these two can be True
        remove_qualifiers: bool, default = False
            Must qualifiers be removed from the queries? If True, the qualifiers tensor will not contain anything.

            This option conflicts with reify. Only one of these two can be True
